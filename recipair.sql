(4, 2, 'Tonkatsu', 'Instructions:\n1. Start by pounding the pork chops to tenderize them. Place each pork chop between two sheets of plastic wrap and gently pound with a meat mallet or rolling pin until they are about 1/4 inch thick. Season both sides of the pork chops with salt and pepper.\n\n2. Set up a breading station. Place the flour on a plate. In a shallow bowl, lightly beat the eggs. Put the panko breadcrumbs on another plate.\n\n3. Dredge each pork chop in the flour, shaking off any excess. Next, dip them into the beaten eggs, allowing the excess to drain off. Finally, coat the pork chops evenly with the panko breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere.\n\n4. Heat vegetable oil in a large frying pan or deep fryer to about 350째F (180째C). Make sure the oil is deep enough to fully submerge the pork chops.\n\n5. Carefully place the breaded pork chops into the hot oil and fry for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. You may need to cook them in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.\n\n6. Once cooked, transfer the tonkatsu to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.\n\n7. Slice the tonkatsu into thick pieces and serve with tonkatsu sauce, shredded cabbage, and cooked rice on the side. You can also garnish with some chopped scallions or serve with a side of miso soup for a complete Japanese meal.\n\nEnjoy your homemade tonkatsu!', '2023-09-22', '2023-09-22', 0, 4.51),

In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and melted butter until well combined.\n3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; it\'s okay if there are a few lumps.\n4. Preheat a non-stick pan or griddle over medium heat. If needed, lightly grease the pan with butter or cooking spray.\n5. Spoon about 1/4 cup of batter onto the pan for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, around 2-3 minutes.\n6. Flip the pancake and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.\n7. Remove the pancake from the pan and keep warm. Repeat the process with the remaining batter.\n8.

(8, 1, 'Crispy Chicken Burger', 'Preheat the oven to 375째F (190째C).\r\nPlace the chicken breasts between two sheets of plastic wrap and gently pound them until they are about 1/2 inch thick.

Transfer the chicken to a baking sheet and finish cooking in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes or until fully cooked through.\r\nWhile the chicken is baking, prepare your burger buns. Toast the buns for a few minutes in a pan or oven until they are slightly crispy.\r\nOnce the chicken is cooked and crispy, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes. Then assemble your crispy chicken burgers.\r\nSpread mayonnaise and mustard on the toasted buns. Place a lettuce leaf on the bottom bun, followed by a crispy chicken breast. Top with sliced tomatoes, onions, and pickles. Finish off with the top bun.\r\nServe immediately and enjoy your delicious crispy chicken burger!

Set aside.\r\nIn a small bowl, mix together the cornstarch and water until smooth. Set aside. This will be used as a thickening agent for the sauce.\r\nSeason the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.\r\nAdd the chicken to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until well-browned and cooked through. This usually takes about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.\r\nIn the same skillet, reduce the heat to medium and add the orange sauce mixture.
